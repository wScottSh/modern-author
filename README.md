# Modern Author

Modern Author is the working title of a bit of software for authors to write books in. It's planned to have a quality writing interface and a focus on writing books of all kinds in a non-proprietary non-binary format with tools to easily connect and use version control.

The main audience is authors that want to have a clean and secure way to write their books and keep track of the extreme amount of changes across the writing and revision process.

## Planned Features

- Cross-platform from the ground up (Electron App?)
- Open source (yay!)
- Built on the shoulders of git
- Connection to push/pull from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
- Clean writing interface
- Files saved as non-proprietary plaintext
- Rich formatting via Markdown
- Simple CSS editing for customized preview of written text
- Exporting into eBook formats
